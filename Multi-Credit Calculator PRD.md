## Individual Credit Calculations

### R&D Payroll Offset Credit

**Qualification Logic:**
```
IF business_rd_spending >= $5000 AND annual_payroll_taxes > $0
THEN eligible = true
```

**Credit Calculation:**
- Base Credit = MIN(rd_spending * 0.20, $250000)
- Payroll Offset = MIN(base_credit, annual_payroll_taxes)
- Conservative Estimate = payroll_offset * 0.60 (60% qualification rate)

**User Questions:**
1. R&D spending amount (range slider)
2. Estimated annual payroll taxes (calculated from hire count √ó average wage estimate)

**Estimated Values:**
- Small R&D ($5K-$25K): 60% qualify, average $3,000 credit
- Medium R&D ($25K-$100K): 70% qualify, average $12,000 credit  
- Large R&D ($100K+): 80% qualify, average $35,000 credit

---

### Empowerment Zone Credit

**Qualification Logic:**
```
IF business_in_empowerment_zone = true AND employee_category_selected.includes('empowerment_zone')
THEN eligible = true
```

**Credit Calculation:**
- Qualified Employees = total_hires √ó 0.15 (15% conservative estimate)
- Credit Per Employee = $15000 √ó 0.20 = $3000 max
- Total Credit = qualified_employees √ó $3000

**Empowerment Zone Locations:**
- Atlanta, GA
- Baltimore, MD  
- Chicago, IL
- Cleveland, OH
- Detroit, MI
- New York, NY (certain areas)
- Philadelphia, PA

**User Questions:**
1. Business zip code (to determine EZ eligibility)
2. Employee residence checkbox (if in EZ area)

## Credit Stacking Rules

### Stacking Compatibility Matrix
| Credit 1 | Credit 2 | Can Stack? | Notes |
|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| WOTC | R&D Payroll | ‚úÖ | Different tax types |
| WOTC | Empowerment Zone | ‚ùå | Same employee cannot qualify for both |
| WOTC | State Credits | ‚úÖ | Most states allow stacking |
| R&D | Empowerment Zone | ‚úÖ | Different qualification criteria |
| R&D | State Credits | ‚úÖ | No restrictions |
| Empowerment Zone | State Credits | ‚ö†Ô∏è | State-dependent |

### Stacking Calculation Logic
```javascript
function calculateStackedCredits(wotc, rd, empowerment, state) {
  // WOTC and Empowerment Zone are mutually exclusive per employee
  const hiringCredits = Math.max(wotc, empowerment) + state;
  
  // R&D can stack with all hiring credits
  const totalCredits = hiringCredits + rd;
  
  return Math.round(totalCredits / 100) * 100; // Round to nearest $100
}
```
